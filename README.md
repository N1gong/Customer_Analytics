### Customer Analytics focuses on the use of data and machine learning to create, develop, and maintain exchanges with individual customers. Many firms have extensive information about customersâ€™ behavior. However, few firms have the expertise to act intelligently on such information. The projects will take advantage of the modern analytics driven approach to marketing to collect, analyze, and act on customer data.  

### With the power of customer analytics, we help business to overcome the problems such as:

  - Organizations are used to thinking about products not customers
  - Collecting useful customer data can be challenging
  - Data sources can be difficult to combine
  - Determining the value of a customer can be challenging
  - Good customer analytics (often) requires sophisticated modeling
  - Managers have, traditionally, been bad at analytics, while statisticians and data scientists are usually bad at making business decisions
  - Managers are not used to making decisions with data acquisition in mind
